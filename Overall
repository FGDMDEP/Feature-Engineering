# CATEGORICAL DATA
# ----------------

# Integer Encoding [implies ordinal variables > possible issue > may or may not make sense depending on context]
  # Does not increase features number


# One-Hot Encoding [Dummy Variables]
  # Each category into features > expands features set
  # Can reduce resulting features by creating higher level categories
  # Dummy Variable Trap [multicollinearity] > features can be duplicated (for example with binary categories)
  # Not easy to add new categories
